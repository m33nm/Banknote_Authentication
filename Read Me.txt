1. Title: 	Banknote authentication using classification machine learning techniques

2. Introduction: 

	It employs 2 classification algorithms; K-Nearest Neighbor and Artificial Neural Network  
	to build models that predicts whether a banknote is authentic or forged given a series of extracted measures
	(Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis, and Entropy) from a Wavelet Transformed images of both types of banknote.

3. Data source:	 The dataset is public, available for research.
		It was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository
		https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication

4. Framework: Jupyter Notebook (anaconda3)

5. How to run the code:	install Jupyter Notebook, open the source file "Task1a" via the framework, save the dataset "data_banknote_authentication" 
			to your working directory, and run the file. Open the second file "Task1a-ANN version 3" and run

6. Number of instances: 1372

7. Number of attributes: 5

8. Missing attribute values: None

9. Attribute information:

Attribute name		Description 													Value type
1)	Variance	Variance of Wavelet Transformed image is a measure of the ‘spread’ of a distribution about its average value	Continuous
2)	Skewness	Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image tells about the direction of variation of the lack of symmetry		Continuous
3)	Kurtosis	Kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed image is a parameter that describes the peakedness of the distribution		Continuous
4)	Entropy		Entropy of image is the measure of disorder or uncertainty							Continuous
5)	Class		Class label contains two values (0 & 1), where 0 represents genuine banknotes, and 1 represents fake banknotes	Integer
